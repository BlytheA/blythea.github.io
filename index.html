  <p>Ethel Parnham (born Ethel Chill Towers) was born in 1890 to British parents on an Island off the coast of Malaysia, formally Malaya, which it was called at the time. There, Ethel grew up on an island, which was then home to the British Crown Colony named Penang Straits Settlement.
  </br>
  </br>
  Ethel’s father had a respected job assisting the King of Penang. The family lived on the island of Penang in a bungalow where young Ethel had many Malayan friends and received a spiritual and academic education. During her formative years, Ethel had a Nanny (called an ‘ayah’ in local tongue) to care for her, who slept on a matt on the floor of Ethel’s room at night.
  </br>
  At age 19 Ethel and her mother, Mrs Chill, set out for the big move to Australia. During this journey, Ethel met an Australian man aboard her ship by the name of Charles Jenkin Parnham. Ethel joined Charles to migrate to his hometown of Melbourne, where they soon married.
  </br>
  </br>
  While a young Ethel began starting a family and new life in Mentone, her mother migrated again, moving to Singapore indefinitely. Ethel, still very young, was now alone with her new husband and small children in a foreign land.
  </br>
  </br>
  Upon arrival to Melbourne, it was the little things that gave Ethel the greatest culture shock. Cow’s Milk was uncommon in Penang. Instead, the people of Penang bought goat’s milk and butter, which came wrapped in plantain leaves. If anyone wanted dairy butter, it was available for purchase in tins at local shops.
  </br>
  </br>
  When Ethel went to a grosser shop in Australia with her husband, she took one look at a box of butter and asked him “what is that?”
  According to her notes, her husband was greatly embarrassed by this.
  </br>
  In 1919, Ethel’s husband Charles decided to buy a hotel the bush after his overseas export business collapsed due to the First World War. The hotel they were to run was in a rural Eastern town that was then, nothing but a relatively uninhibited stop over location for people travelling through the bush. Today, it is known as the suburban and industrial area of Lower Fern Tree Gully.
  </br>
  </br>
  And so, in winter of 1919, Ethel, her husband Charles, three children, new baby and au pair huddled into a horse – drawn car, left the life they knew, and headed for the bush.
  </br>
  As they ventured further and further out, Ethel noticed the trees and bush-land growing denser and denser as the horses carried them to their new home. It was a rainy winters day, which did not comfort the already apprehensive young mother.
  Ethel did not like the idea of raising her children in a desolate rural hotel environment but did as her husband chose. Coming from Penang, she knew little about how to cook Australian food or count Australian money. As they rode nearer, fears of dangerous bushrangers crept into her mind. The children were excited for life in the bush and eager to arrive, she did not dare to express her concern for fear it would break the children’s excitement.
  </br>
  </br>
  Finally they reached their destination, it was known as ‘The Pub in the Gully’.
  </br>
  </br>
  </br>
  The family shortly made friends with the locals. One man, a local farmer named Jack, told Ethel he owned a few guns, when she asked in the interest of her family’s safety. Ethel writes of being excited to meet Jack, as he was the first farmer she had seen “in the flesh,” as there were none in her birthplace of Penang, the nearest there being “a few Chinese market gardeners,” she explained.
  </br>
  When winter finally came to an end, Ethel noted being enchanted by even the small wonders of the bush in spring. Uninhabited lands of grass and dirt were the homes of leeches that wanted nothing more than to cling to the skin on her feet in Penang. Here, Ethel marveled at the thought of walking on grass bare-footed.
  </br>
  </br>
  “I compared the healthy innocence of this bush-land with the miasmic jungles of my birthplace, where reptiles and venomous insects lurked for the unwary intruder,” read her notes about this time.
  </br>
  As she gazed at the view of the Dandenong Ranges from the surrounding bush lands of Fern Tree Gully, she writes the look of the hills began “reminding me nostalgically of my Penang Hills.”
  </br>
  </br>
  Ethel encountered many interesting characters as she met passers by at the pub. Throughout her first year there, she often saw groups of returned soldiers from the First World War. Ethel wrote about meeting visiting veterans and although she had never met a soldier before moving to the hotel she observed, “from their far away looks I was sure they were ‘seeing’ some of their mates ‘lying out there’.”
  </br>
  </br>
  After about a year, Ethel’s husband Charles started spending most of his time away on business in Melbourne, leaving Ethel to run the hotel alone. It was also around this time that Ethel’s back begun to cause her pain. At first she didn’t worry too much but when it started effecting her work her dear friend, who was also named Ethel, decided to bring a friend with her on her next visit who was also a doctor.
  </br>
  Ethel and Bruce arrived on Melbourne Cup day of 1920. Ethel Parnham was very excited to welcome them on the Spring day of national celebration and her children warmed to Bruce immediately. The children were not the only ones, Ethel found herself completely charmed by the young doctor. He seemed concerned about Ethel’s health and assured her he’d be back before too long.
  </br>
  </br>
  One day two well-dressed men arrived for a meal while on their way to their country house in the quaint town of Olinda, located in the Dandenong Ranges. Ethel’s notes recall the younger of the two asking her why she worked there, saying “you don’t look the type of person one usually finds running a hotel,” to which she responded by telling him the story of her upbringing in Malaya.
  </br>
  When the younger man left to see the garden and his accomplice came to the bar to pay the bill he asked her if she knew who the man she’d just been talking to was. She confessed that she didn’t, chuckling he responded with “well, he is your Prime Minister, Mr. William Morris Hughes”.
  </br>
  </br>
  Not too long after this encounter, the Victorian Licensing Board threatened to shut down The Pub in the Gully, saying there were too many licensed hotels in the area. Ethel wrote to Prime Minister Hughes to get his advice. He wrote back to her and contacted the Licensing Board personally. This prevented the action from being taken, as seen in image and audio reference provided.
  </br>
  </br>
  Unfortunately, not all visitors were as likeable as Billy Hughes. One evening, when the staff had just gone home and the children had just been put to bed, a man Ethel described as “diminutive but not unattractive,” arrived at the pub and requested a meal, claiming to be a traveler. He was well groomed and wearing a suit tailored to his unusual height.
  </br>
  At the end of the meal, the man took a firm hold of Ethel’s arm with one hand and reached up her dress with the other, forcing her to sit as he pressed his mouth against her unwilling lips.
  </br>
  </br>
  “Let me go, you brute, let me go at once,” Ethel continued to scream.
  </br>
  Eventually he let her go, but only on the condition that she would join him for dinner that night when he returned. At the sight of his gun, Ethel pretended to look forward to these plans. Once he had left, she contacted the police and friends who came over and swore to keep her safe upon the man’s arrival. The man, who the police later informed her was the most wanted man in Australia, never returned.
  </br>
  </br>
  This man was the infamous Australian bushranger, Squizzy Taylor.
  </br>
  </br>
  It was around this time that Ethel began to consider a new life. After a few more visits from Bruce they had, by now, fallen in love and he hoped to marry her take her and her children to England to live. After the incident with Squizzy Taylor, she agreed to migrate one more time.
  Her husband, Charles, was not contactable and Ethel and Bruce feared they might not be able to gain permission for a divorce.
  </br>
  </br>
  When Ethel’s back pain took a turn for the worst in the months proceeding, Charles sold the hotel and bought a home for Ethel and the children in 1922.
  </br>
  </br>
  Shortly after, an x-ray confirmed Ethel would require surgery, she and Bruce planned to move to England with her children indefinitely. Unfortunately, Bruce had to leave before she was well enough to join him, for work. He gave her his Mother’s ring and promised to meet her there in a month to marry.
  </br>
  </br>
  A week after his departure, her husband Charles came home with a telegram.
  </br>
  It was from her brother Mark, who lived in England and read “Bruce was killed in a motor car accident here some days ago”.
  </br>
  </br>
  </br>
  Ethel was brought back to health and continued to live in Melbourne with her husband and children. She lived happily there, until she died in 1976 at the age of 86.</p>
